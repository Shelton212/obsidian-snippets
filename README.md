## Clutter-Free Headings

<https://github.com/Shelton212/obsidian-snippets/blob/master/Clutter-Free%20Headings.css>
WYSIWYG-ish headings which line up headings, show the formatting markers when editing
and replace them with a muted "H1", "H2" etc when not the active line

I modified it is based on [this version](https://github.com/deathau/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/clutter-free-headings.css) because it only works on  legacy editor
